Headcount = COUNTROWS(staff)

- **Average Salary**
  
AvgSalary = AVERAGE(staff[Salary])

- **Cumulative Headcount**
  
CumulativeHeadcount = CALCULATE(
[Headcount],
FILTER(ALL(staff[Date of Join]), staff[Date of Join] <= MAX(staff[Date of Join]))
)

- **Leave Balance Over 20 Days**
  
LBLover20days = CALCULATE([Headcount], staff[Leave Balance] > 20)

- **Minimum and Maximum Salary by Job Title**
  
MinSalary = MIN(staff[Salary])
MaxSalary = MAX(staff[Salary])
